# Admissions website

This is the source code that drives the [admissions website] of the
department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute
of Technology, Kanpur.

## Building this site.

This is a static website generated using [Hakyll]. Any version >=4.5
should be okey for this. Besides we use twitter bootstrap to style the
website (include with the source). You can use the following command
while working with the site.


```bash
make build # build the site
make watch # run a development server on localhost:8000 for testing
```
