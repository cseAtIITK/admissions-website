title: Reaching IIT Kanpur.

## By Rail

Kanpur is an important rail junction in northern India so chances are
that there is a direct train from you city to Kanpur. Please try to
get a ticket to the Kanpur Central (Station code CNB) station. The
Delhi-Kanpur route is particularly well served. However, tickets might
be difficult to obtain in short notice. Some of the better options are
the following.

- The night train *Shram Shakti* #12452
- Lucknow *Shatabdi* #12004
- Kanpur *Shatabdi* #12034 (except Sundays)
- Any of the many east bound *Rajdhani* expresses.


The southern cities are not that well connected to Kanpur. In case of
difficulty in getting a direct train to Kanpur, consider taking a
ticket to Jhansi instead. One can then reach Kanpur either by bus or
local trains.

## By Air

Lucknow Airport

:   There are good connecting flights from Delhi, Mumbai, Banglore,
    Calcutta to Lucknow. IIT Kanpur is about 90Kms from Lucknow


Kanpur Airport

:   This is the least preferred way to reach Kanpur. If you plan to take
    a flight consider Lucknow instead.

## Reaching IIT Kanpur

Taxis and auto-rikshaws are available from Kanpur central station. From
Lucknow airport one can hire a pre-paid taxi.
