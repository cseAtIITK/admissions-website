title: Why do post graduation from IIT Kanpur?
---

IIT Kanpur was one of the first institutes to offer degrees in
computer science and engineering. If you want to explore the cutting
edge of knowledge, doing a post graduate degree from IIT Kanpur is one
of the best options. Here is why:

## Flexible course structure

The department offers a wide variety of courses related to computer
science and engineering and students are encouraged to take up open
problems as their course projects, many students publish excellent
research papers by solving these problems as their course
projects. While the courses offered in systems engineering cover
various design methodologies at conceptual level, the assignments
include the programming aspects of these methodologies. Some of the
highlights of the course structure are:

-   No compulsory courses. All courses are electives.
-   The course *Special topics in Computer Science* allow the students
    to do an independent study by taking guidance from a professor.
-   Students are allowed to audit as many courses as they wish.
-   A special introductory course on theoretical computer science is
    offered for first year students to greatly improve their theoretical
    capabilities.
-   The content of a course range from necessary basics to
    state-of-the-art in that area.
-   Students are given 15 days time to select their courses in a
    semester.

## Good research environment

The department provides an excellent research platform and challenges
the student’s potential to solve tough problems. In addition to
institution facilities like the 2 GBPS Internet connection, CSE
department provides additional facilities. Some of the highlights of
our research environment are:

-   24×7 access to lab resources.
-   24×7 access to class rooms for group discussions.
-   Continuous upgrades of Hardware and Software technologies.
-   Each student is given a free 50-100 pages printout per month.
-   For second year masters students, a separate lab of capacity six
    students is allocated for each research group. In this lab, each
    student is given a high performance desktop machine with
    administrator rights.
-   More weightage is given to thesis work than course work.
-   Regularly organizes conferences, workshops, and seminars inviting
    the prominent researchers from all fields of computer science
    discussing the state-of-the-art research.
-   STAR (STudent Academic Research) board at the department entrance
    displays the student publication details and photograph of the
    student.
-   Institute provides partial financial support to students for
    presenting their work at International Conference and the financial
    support is usually supplemented by the supervisor of the student
    through project funding..
-   In addition to central library, department maintains its own
    library. All the text books for the course work and research work
    are available. Different magazines related to technology are also
    available.
-   Department is always ready to accept and rapidly implement any good
    suggestions from the student community.
-   Many students are pursuing PhDs in same department after their UG/PG
    programme, this shows that students are extremely satisfied with the
    facilities and quality of research in the department.
-   Students from multiple related research areas form a *Special
    Interest Group* and organize lectures and group discussion among
    themselves. *SIGTACS* (Special Interest Group in Theoretical Aspects
    of Computer Science), and *SIGML* (Special Interest Group in Machine
    Learning) are two most active groups.

## Excellent job opportunity

-   Students are offered highly paid jobs in both Technology and
    Financial enterprises.
-   Many students drop the highly paid jobs and pursue PhD in top
    universities like *Princeton*, *Stanford*, *Berkeley, IITK* etc.
-   Students are also placed in research labs like *IBM Research Labs
    India*, *Microsoft Research India*, *Yahoo Research India*, *Intel
    Research Labs India* etc. Students usually get 3 month internship
    offers in top research labs like *Google labs Silicon valley*,
    *Microsoft Redmond* etc.
-   Since the number of students in a batch is low, all of them will be
    placed mostly in the first 10 companies (sorted by their salaries).

## Vibrant student life

There are 11 students' hostels, each equipped with its own canteen, TV
room, reading room, sports facilities like table tennis, carrom,
badminton, basketball. There are various clubs at the institute level,
e.g. music, dance, various sports. With a unique collection of
cultural, sports, business and technical festivals, IITK offers a
fulfilling and entertaining stay complementing the world of academics
and making it the memorable years of your student life
