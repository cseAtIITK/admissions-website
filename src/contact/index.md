Email is the preferred means of communication. During the admission
season, we get a lot of queries. It becomes difficult to answer all of
them. Before sending an email ensure that:

1. You have read the [Frequently asked questions][faq] and your query
   is not answered there. We may refuse to respond to your query if we
   believe that the [faq] answers your question satisfactorily.

2. Make sure you read the latest announcements. In particular, we will
   declare the results through such announcements on our homepage.

3. Make sure that you send your email in plain text. Avoid html and
   pdf as much as possible. Please *do not* send doc/docx files. We
   will not open such mails.

4. Please ensure that you have a valid subject field in your mail.

You can send your mail to admissions at iitk.ac.in.
