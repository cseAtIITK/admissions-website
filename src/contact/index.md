2. Make sure you read the latest [announcements]. In particular, we
   will declare the results through such announcements on our
   homepage.

3. Please ensure that you have a valid subject field, and a valid from
   address in your mail.

4. Make sure that you send your email in plain text. Avoid html and
   pdf as much as possible. Please *do not* send doc/docx files. We
   will not open such mails.
