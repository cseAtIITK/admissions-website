# General.

## Should I take a post-graduate degree in Computer Science from IIT Kanpur?

Absolutely, yes. See [why](/why/)

## When are the tests/interviews?

For selection to our M.Tech program, the interviews and tests are held
in the beginning of May. Ph. D candidates are selected two times a
year, once in the month of December and once in May.

In addition, for exceptional Ph.D candidates, we conduct walk-in
interviews all through the year. You have to arrange for the dates in
advance.

Look out for announcements on our [homepage](/)

# M.Tech admissions

## Should I have a valid GATE score for M.Tech admission?

Unless you are a sponsored or part-time student you do need a valid
[GATE] score. However, starting from the academic session of 2015, we
give admissions to selected final B.Tech students of any of the CFTI's
direct admission without [GATE]. See the [announcement][direct-phd].


## What is the syllabus for the entrance test/interview at IITK?

The test has the same syllabus as that of [GATE]. During the interview,
the panel will ask you similar questions in greater detail.

## Is there a fixed number of candidates who are selected?

No. We have usually 30-40 students joining the M.Tech programme every
year. However, we will select more candidates if we find them
suitable, and likely to succeed in our PG programme.

## Can I do a part-time M. Tech?

We rarely select part-time M. Tech students.  We do not run special
evening classes we feel it will be difficult for such candidates to
succeed in our program.


## Is an M.C.A. eligible to apply for M.Tech?

Yes. The same qualification criteria as B.Tech students apply.

## I am working as a teacher. How do I apply for an M.Tech?

Please apply through the QIP programme.  The eligibility criteria
mentioned there, apply.

## When will I know the results?

We release the results typically within a week of the interview. The
selected candidates will be listed one our website. We will also mail
the candidates individually.

Please look out for announcements on our [main page](/)

# Ph.D admissions

## Should I have a [GATE] score for a Ph.D?

For M.Tech/M.E students:
:    If you have an M.Tech or M.E. degree in any discipline with minimum
     requirements from a recognized university, there is no need for
     [GATE].  This includes dual degrees (B.Tech-M.Tech dual) from
     places which offer this, like BITS Pilani. If you have doubts
     about whether your postgraduate degree is recognized, please
     contact (admissions at cse.iitk.ac.in). The minimum requirements
     are given in Section 2. of the [PG Manual].

For B.Tech, M.C.A. and M.Sc. Computer Science students (general):
:   The [GATE] score is necessary to obtain a stipend from the Ministry
    of Human Resources Development, Govt. of India. Note that this is
    technically **not** an admission requirement, but is practically
    relevant. Unlike M.Tech admission, Ph.D. admission has **no
    cutoff** for [GATE] score. We will select candidates based on
    their performance in our admission test and interview. The exact
    requirements are given in Section 2 of the PG manual, *here*.

	Recently M.H.R.D has allowed admission of final year B.Tech
	students from any of the C.F.T.I's. For details consult the
	[announcement on our homepage][direct-phd]


## What is the syllabus for the test/interview for Ph.D candidates?

The test has the same syllabus as that of [GATE]. Besides asking
questions in greater depth, the interview panel will also ask specific
questions based on the area that you want to work on, for your Ph.D.

## Is there a fixed number of candidates who will be selected?


No. We will select all able candidates. What we are looking for are
competent, motivated students who are highly likely to succeed our Ph.D
programme.

## What do I need to apply as a sponsored candidate?

The requirements can be summarised as follows (Details check the
[pg manual])

1. At least 2 years of experience with the current employer

2. A written letter from your employer agreeing to relieve you for the
   duration of your Ph.D.

3. You need a written letter from your employer agreeing to **sponsor
   your Ph.D**. This is very important, and we will not consider
   applications without this.

Candidates will have to still pass the test/interview at IITK. Only
the [GATE] requirement is waived for sponsored candidates.

## Can I do a part-time Ph.D?

There is a provision for a part-time Ph.D. If you're selected after
the test/interview, and want to do a part-time Ph.D, you have to do
the following.

There are 3 components for a Ph.D - coursework for about 2 years and a
qualifying exam, and thesis work after that. During the time you take
coursework and the qualifier, you have to attend classes during normal
hours. (There are no evening classes, weekend classes etc. solely for
part-time students.) This means that you will have to be on Campus
during these 2 years.

Afterwards, during the thesis requirements, the institute specifies
that the students be "local". This is vague, and we will liberally
interpret it --- you can make an arrangement with your Ph.D guide
about this.

## Can I do an external Ph.D?

Yes. You need to be working at your current institution for more than
2 years. You also need a written consent from your employer, relieving
you from duties.

Moreover, you need a person who can supervise you at **your location
outside IITK campus**. If you don't have someone of that sort, then you
could try for a part-time Ph.D.

Such students are selected through our test/interview. External Ph.D
students need not have a [GATE] score.

## What is the difference between external and part-time Ph.D?

External Ph.D was designed to be able to do a Ph.D from another
academic, scientific or research institution. In effect, it means that
you should be working at a location where at least one person is
willing and **able** to supervise your Ph.D work.

Part-time Ph.D can be done by a person who is currently working in a
setting where (s)he need not have any Ph.D guide - for example, in the
industry.

## Is an M.C.A. eligible to apply for Ph.D?

Yes. Please see the question on *[GATE] score* for details.

## How long does a Ph.D take?

It really depends. You have to spend time to finish the coursework and
qualifiers, which takes about 2 years.

The typical duration for a Ph.D degree is about 5 years. But students
have graduated with a Ph.D degree from the CSE department in around 3
years.

Unlike any other degree that you do, a Ph.D degree does not have a fixed
duration, or a predefined outcome. It depends on a willingness to
explore, and to do research at the highest level. There is no minimum
period you have to spend, just a level of quality and productivity that
you have to meet.


# Travel and Accommodation.

## How do I reach IIT Kanpur.

See our [travelling page]

## Where do I stay?

We will arrange the accommodation for you.

## Do I need to bring anything with me other than the certificates?

For the test/interviews held during winter consider bringing warm clothes,
blankets etc. Kanpur can get quite cold during the month of December.
