## I am a foreign national. How do I apply?

The procedure is same as for Indian national --- check the
[notices][doaa]. You can however ignore the last dates mentioned
there.

## I would like to do an M.Tech/Ph.D as a sponsored candidate. What do I need?

The requirements can be summarised as follows (Details check the
[pg manual])

1. At least 2 years of experience with the current employer.

2. A written letter from your employer agreeing to relieve you for the
   duration of your stay at IIT Kanpur.

3. You need a written letter from your employer agreeing to **sponsor
   you** by providing you *full salary* during your period of
   study. This is very important, and we will not consider
   applications without this.

Candidates will have to still pass the test/interview at IITK. Only
the [GATE] requirement is waived for sponsored candidates.

## When are the tests/interviews?

M.Tech admissions:
:   For selection to our M.Tech program, the interviews and tests are
    usually held in the beginning of May.


Ph. D admissions:

:   Ph.D selections happens twice an year, once in the month of December
    and once in May. In addition, for exceptional Ph.D candidates, we
    conduct walk-in interviews all through the year. You have to
    arrange for the dates in advance.

Look out for announcements on our [homepage](/)

# M.Tech admissions

## Should I have a valid GATE score for M.Tech admission?

Unless you are a sponsored or part-time student you do need a valid
[GATE] score.

## I am a final year B.Tech student in a C.F.T.I. Do I require GATE?

At present the direct admission, i.e. with out [GATE], is only for
Ph.D admissions and not M.Tech admissions.

## What is the syllabus for the entrance test/interview at IITK?

The test has the same syllabus as that of [GATE]. During the interview,
the panel will ask you similar questions in greater detail.

## Is there a fixed number of candidates who are selected?

No. We have usually 30-40 students joining the M.Tech programme every
year. However, we will select more candidates if we find them
suitable, and likely to succeed in our PG programme.

## Can I do a part-time M. Tech?

We rarely select part-time M. Tech students.  We do not run special
evening classes we feel it will be difficult for such candidates to
succeed in our program.


## Is an M.C.A. eligible to apply for M.Tech?

Yes. The same qualification criteria as B.Tech students apply.

## I am working as a teacher. How do I apply for an M.Tech?

Please apply through the QIP programme.  The eligibility criteria
mentioned there, apply.

## When will I know the results?

We release the results typically within a week of the interview. The
selected candidates will be listed one our website. We will also mail
the candidates individually.

Please look out for announcements on our [main page](/)

# Ph.D admissions

## Should I have a GATE score for a Ph.D?

For M.Tech/M.E students:
:    If you have an M.Tech or M.E. degree in any discipline with minimum
     requirements from a recognized university, there is no need for
     [GATE].  This includes dual degrees (B.Tech-M.Tech dual) from
     places which offer this, like BITS Pilani. If you have doubts
     about whether your postgraduate degree is recognized, please
     contact (admissions at cse.iitk.ac.in). The minimum requirements
     are given in Section 2 of the [PG Manual].

For B.Tech, M.C.A. and M.Sc. Computer Science students (general):
:   For Ph. D students, we provide Ph.D scholarship against teaching
    assistance in the courses taught here. The [GATE] score
    is necessary to obtain such a teaching assistanctship from the
    Ministry of Human Resources Development, Govt. of India. Note that
    this is technically **not** an admission requirement, but is
    practically relevant. Unlike M.Tech admission, Ph.D. admission has
    **no cutoff** for [GATE] score. We will select candidates based on
    their performance in our admission test and interview. The exact
    requirements are given in Section 2 of the [PG manual].

Direct admission for final year B.Tech students:

:   Recently [M.H.R.D][mhrd] approved teaching assistantship for
    admission of final year B.Tech students from any of the
    [CFTI]s. These candidates *need not* have a valid GATE score.  You
    can apply to us either in the summer (usually some time in May) or
    in winter (usually in December). Once you have cleared our written
    test and interview you will be given a provisional admission.  You
    will need a CPI of 7.5 at the time of qualifying to get this
    provisional admissions confirmed. For details consult the
    [announcement on our homepage][direct-phd].


## I am eligible for direct admission to PhD. However, I missed the December admissions. What should I do?

Please apply in the May session. The December admission for candidates
eligible for [direct admissions][direct-phd] is an enabler, and it
*does not* preclude you from applying in May.

## Should I apply in December or in May?

In general, you should apply in December *only if* you can/are willing
to join IIT Kanpur in the winter semester, i.e. the semester that
starts immediately in January. However, if you are a final year B.Tech
student from one of the [CFTI]s and want to apply to us via the
[Direct admission][direct-phd] scheme, then consider applying in the
month of December itself *even though* you can join only in the
subsequent summer.

To illustrate, here are four examples (we are currently in Oct of
2014)

Donald:
:   Is currently doing his M.Tech and is expected to complete in June of
    2015. He is keen on working on algorithms. We recommend applying
    in the summer of 2015 (some where around May).

Alan:
:   Already has an M.Tech degree and is fixing COBOL bugs in an
    outsourcing company. He is fed up with his job and fondly
    remembers the time he spent breaking the encryption scheme behind
    the [enigma] machine. We recommend him applying for the December
    2014 admissions session so that he can join us *tout suite*
    (semester starting end December).

Ada:
:   She is a final year B.Tech student at a [CFTI] and will finish
    her UG program some time in May 2015. Her dream is to work on the
    programming aspects of the recently proposed [Analytic Engine]. We
    recommend her applying in December. She can then join us in the
    summer of 2015.

Bhaskara:
:   He is a final year B.Tech student at a [CFTI] and will finish his UG
    program some time in May 2015. Ever since he has been working on
    perfecting the [chakravala] method, he has been forgetful about
    deadlines and has missed the December admission process. We
    recommend him applying in the next summer (sometime in May 2015). He
    can avail the direct admission clause for the summer admissions as well.
    Next time be more careful about deadlines otherwise your work will
    be know by [other peoples names][pells].


In the future, we might change the process. Please keep an eye on the
announcements section of our main page.

## What is the syllabus/format for the test/interview for Ph.D candidates?

We use the test to screen the short listed candidates.  The test has
the same syllabus as that of [GATE] and involves basics in computer
science and aptitude. Although the interview is also based on the same
syllabus, we would like to gauge the depth of understanding of the
candidate. Often, you would be asked questions in specific topics
which *you* are comfortable with or in areas that you want to work on
for your Ph. D.

## Is there a fixed number of candidates who will be selected?

No. We will select all able candidates. What we are looking for are
competent, motivated students who are highly likely to succeed our Ph.D
programme.


## Can I do a part-time Ph.D?

There is a provision for a part-time Ph.D. If you're selected after
the test/interview, and want to do a part-time Ph.D, you have to do
the following.

There are 3 components for a Ph.D - coursework for about 2 years and a
qualifying exam, and thesis work after that. During the time you take
coursework and the qualifier, you have to attend classes during normal
hours. (There are no evening classes, weekend classes etc. solely for
part-time students.) This means that you will have to be on Campus
during these 2 years.

Afterwards, during the thesis requirements, the institute specifies
that the students be "local". This is vague, and we will liberally
interpret it --- you can make an arrangement with your Ph.D guide
about this.

## Can I do an external Ph.D?

Yes. You need to be working at your current institution for more than
2 years. You also need a written consent from your employer, relieving
you from duties.

Moreover, you need a person who can supervise you at **your location
outside IITK campus**. If you don't have someone of that sort, then you
could try for a part-time Ph.D.

Such students are selected through our test/interview. External Ph.D
students need not have a [GATE] score.

## What is the difference between external and part-time Ph.D?

External Ph.D was designed to be able to do a Ph.D from another
academic, scientific or research institution. In effect, it means that
you should be working at a location where at least one person is
willing and **able** to supervise your Ph.D work.

Part-time Ph.D can be done by a person who is currently working in a
setting where (s)he need not have any Ph.D guide - for example, in the
industry.

## Is an M.C.A. eligible to apply for Ph.D?

Yes. Please see the question on *[GATE] score* for details.

## How long does a Ph.D take?

It really depends. You have to spend time to finish the coursework and
qualifiers, which takes about 2 years.

The typical duration for a Ph.D degree is about 5 years. But students
have graduated with a Ph.D degree from the CSE department in around 3
years.

Unlike any other degree that you do, a Ph.D degree does not have a fixed
duration, or a predefined outcome. It depends on a willingness to
explore, and to do research at the highest level. There is no minimum
period you have to spend, just a level of quality and productivity that
you have to meet.


# Travel and Accommodation.

## How do I reach IIT Kanpur.

See the [travel info page][travel]

## Where do I stay?

We will arrange the accommodation for you.

## Do I need to bring anything with me other than the certificates?

For the test/interviews held during winter consider bringing warm clothes,
blankets etc. Kanpur can get quite cold during the month of December.
