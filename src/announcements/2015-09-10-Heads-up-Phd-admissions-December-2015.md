<!--more-->

The December round of Ph.D admissions are on. The test and interviews
will be held on *5th and 6th of December 2015*. If you are planning
apply consider booking the tickets right away so as to avoid the
difficulty of last minute bookings.


### How to apply?

This time we plan to have an online application process. The site will
be up by the end of this month.

### Who can apply?

As usual, winter admissions are for selecting Ph.D candidates and we
will not entertain application toward our masters program. This time
around we will also admit sponsored candidates for the new [M.S.
program][ms]. A candidate selected for this round is expected to join our
Ph.D program in the winter semester itself. Besides, this time around,
candidates interested in the application under the
[Visvesvaraya scheme][vishy-sheme] should also apply (no separate
application is required).


Even if you are a final year B. Tech student in one of the C.F.T.Is,
you can apply this time. See our [previous announcement][direct-phd].



### Test and Interviews.

The shortlisted candidates will be called for a screening test
followed by an interview which will be held on *December 5th and 6th,
2015*. Make sure that you are available on both the 5th and 6th of
December.

For any queries please refer to our [FAQs](/faq.html) and the
institute [PG manual].
