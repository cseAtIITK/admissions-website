title: Direct admission to the Ph.D program
---

Are you in the final year of your under graduation? Does exploring the
cutting edge of current knowledge excite you? Then consider joining us
*directly* for a Ph.D.
<!--more-->

We now offer *direct Ph. D admissions* to motivated B.Tech/BE/BS
students in Computer Science (or closely related streams) who are
currently in their final year in any of the *Centrally Funded
Technological Institutions* (CFTIs). To be eligible, you need to have
a CPI (average grade out of 10) of at least 7.5 at the end of the
sixth semester. Having a valid GATE score is *not* mandatory. However,
you will have to appear for the interviews/tests that the department
conducts in the winter (i.e. after seven semesters of
B.Tech). Successful candidates will be given a provisional admission
to the Ph.D program. This admission will be confirmed provided the
student completes his/her undergraduate program with a graduation CPI
of at least 7.5.

Candidates admitted through this route will get a teaching
assistantship as per rules, which for B. Tech graduates directly
admitted to PhD is Rs 16,000/- per month for the first two years which
increases to Rs 18,000/- per month thereafter.
