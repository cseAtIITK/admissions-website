We now offer *direct admissions* to motivated B.Tech students who are
currently in their final years in any of the *Centrally Funded
Technological Institutions* (CFTI). To be eligible, you need to have a
CPI of at least 7.5 at the end of their sixth semester. Having a valid
GATE score is *not* mandatory. However, you will have to appear for
the interviews/tests that the department conducts in the
winter. Successful candidates will be given a provisional admission to
the Ph.D program. This admission will be confirmed provided the
student completes his/her undergraduate program with a graduation CPI
of at least 7.5.

Candidates admitted through this route will get institute stipend as
per rules which for BTech graduates directly admitted to PhD is Rs
16000/- pm for the first two years, and increases by Rs2000/-
p.m. thereafter.
