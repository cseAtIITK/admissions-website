## Ph.D 

We did not find any suitable Ph.D candidates this time.

## M.Tech

This time we offered admissions in three stages.

1. Based on the performance in GATE and their performance in the
   undergraduate course work we offered
   [33 candidates][direct admission] direct admissions of 19
   candidates have finally confirmed admissions by sending the
   required draft.

2. The rest of the candidates were called for a screening test and
   interview. Based on the performance in our screening test we gave
   admissions to a further [19 candidates][after test].

3. Finally, after the interviews we selected another 19 candidates.
