### Test and Interviews.

Any candidate who wishes to join our M.Tech program *should* have a
valid [GATE] score in computer science. Based on the [GATE] scores and
performance in the qualifying exam, we will

   interview.

[GATE] requirement for M.Tech candidates can be waived only for
sponsored candidates. Please check our [FAQs] and [PG manual] for
details on sponsored candidates.

On the other hand, [GATE] is not mandatory for admissions to our Ph. D
program.  However, if you want institute scholarship against teaching
assistance, [GATE] is a required criteria. [GATE] requirement for
scholarship is however waived off for students who are expected to
complete their under graduation from one of the [C.F.T.I's][cfti]

sponsored candidate, then you need not have [GATE] as you are expected
to be funded by your parent organisation.
